# Getting Started with BDD and Cucumber

## Introduction

Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) is an agile software development process that encourages collaboration between developers, QA, and non-technical or business participants in a software project. Cucumber is a popular tool that supports BDD.

This tutorial will guide you through the basics of BDD with Cucumber.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of a programming language (we'll use JavaScript in this tutorial)
- Node.js installed on your system

## Step 1: Set up your project

1. Create a new directory for your project:
   ```
   mkdir bdd-cucumber-demo
   cd bdd-cucumber-demo
   ```

2. Initialize a new Node.js project:
   ```
   npm init -y
   ```

3. Install Cucumber:
   ```
   npm install @cucumber/cucumber
   ```

## Step 2: Write your first feature

Create a new file called `features/calculator.feature`:

```gherkin
Feature: Calculator

  Scenario: Add two numbers
    Given the numbers 5 and 7
    When I add the numbers
    Then the result should be 12
```

This feature file describes the behavior we want to implement.

## Step 3: Implement step definitions

Create a new file called `features/step_definitions/calculator_steps.js`:

```javascript
const assert = require('assert');
const { Given, When, Then } = require('@cucumber/cucumber');

let numbers = [];
let result = 0;

Given('the numbers {int} and {int}', function (num1, num2) {
  numbers = [num1, num2];
});

When('I add the numbers', function () {
  result = numbers.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
});

Then('the result should be {int}', function (expected) {
  assert.strictEqual(result, expected);
});
```

This file implements the steps defined in our feature file.

## Step 4: Run the tests

Add the following script to your `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "cucumber-js"
}
```

Now you can run your tests:

```
npm test
```

You should see output indicating that the test passed.

## Conclusion

Congratulations! You've just created your first BDD test with Cucumber. This is just the beginning â€“ you can now expand on this by adding more scenarios, implementing more complex step definitions, and integrating it into your development workflow.

Remember, the key to successful BDD is collaboration. Use these feature files as a communication tool between developers, testers, and stakeholders to ensure everyone has a shared understanding of the desired behavior of your software.
